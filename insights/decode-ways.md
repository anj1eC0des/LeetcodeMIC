## Test Cases

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation:
"12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation:
"226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

### Example 3

```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation:
"06" cannot be mapped to "F" because of the leading zero ("6" is different from "06"). In this case, the string is not a valid encoding, so return 0.
```
